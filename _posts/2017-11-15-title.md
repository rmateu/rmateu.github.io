<blockquote>Apple has made many great laptops, but the 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro (2012–2015) is the epitome of usefulness, elegance, practicality, and power for an overall package that still hasn’t been (and may never be) surpassed.</blockquote>
Wish I’d written this. An open love letter to a great machine. I still think that an used 13in MacBook Pro is the best value for a laptop nowadays.
