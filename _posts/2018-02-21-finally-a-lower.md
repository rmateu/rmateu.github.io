Finally a lower priced [Nest Aware plan ($5 a month, 3$ additional camera)](https://nest.com/blog/2018/02/21/nest-cams-just-got-even-smarter/). My [Nest wishlist from two years ago](http://5typos.net/dear-new-nest-ceo) is almost done â€“ just need better notifications. 

Still happy with my WyzeCams, not likely to buy additional Nest's.
