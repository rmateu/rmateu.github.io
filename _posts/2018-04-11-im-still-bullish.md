I'm still bullish on Soylent because of its minimalist concept: if you're not going to have a great meal, just drink 400kcal of something cheap (and not unhealthy) and move on. Many don't agree, so it'll be interesting to see how it does [at Walmart](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17226868/soylent-walmart-meal-substitute).
